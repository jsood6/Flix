Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1.Adding the filter for movies, since I tried so hard to implement it but I still couldn't figure it out! I did all the right steps, but not sure why, my searchBar text was always recognized as empty so it didn't work.
2.See what extra stuff other people added to their apps and get inspired! :)
